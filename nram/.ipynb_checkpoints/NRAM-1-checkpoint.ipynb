However, most algorithms are *not* differentiable, and so we must have a separate system from the neural network perform the main computation.\n",
    "2. *Upgrade our machine piece-by-piece.* By delegating part of the logic to a network-external system, we can increase the computational capability of the network by adding new capabilities to the external system without redesigning or drastically increasing the size of the network. This can provide us with a large boost in expressivity with a fairly limited increase in the number of parameters and the training time required. We'll see this flexibility in action later in this post!"

    "Our machine will consist of three main pieces: registers, gates, and the controller. The registers form the data storage space for the machine, the gates will perform computation on the registers, and the controller will direct the gates to control what computation they do. At each timestep, the controller will choose how to wire the registers and gates together, creating a neural circuit, and the outputs of circuit will be written back to the registers. In this way, complex expressions can be computed, since the controller can choose different gates and operations on the registers at every timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary challenge presented by this design is that of differentiability. Recall that neural networks are trained by formulating a *cost function* that captures how well the network is doing, differentiating that cost function with respect to the network parameters, and then using an optimization algorithm (such as gradient descent) to find appropriate network parameters. For this to work, we must be able to differentiate the result of the neural network with respect to its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if in our machine the gates perform logical operations and integer arithmetic, and the registers store integers, how can this entire system be end-to-end differentiable, a requirement for backpropagation training?

If we denote the maximum representable integer $M-1$, and the set of representable integers be $\\Z_M = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, M - 1\\}$, then each of our registers is a probability distribution over $\\Z_M$, which can be represented as a vector $r_i \\in \\R^M$, such that the components of each $r_i$ are non-negative and sum to one.\n",

For example, the constant ZERO can be represented as a probability distribution over $\\Z_M$, where the probability of zero is one and the probability of all other values is zero:\n",

    "The same generalization can be applied to any integer functions; in the general case of a binary function $f_i$, the probability of the output being a particular integer $\\ell$ is the sum of the probabilities of all the cases in which the inputs produce an output of $\\ell$.

    "\n",
    "Instead, the controller chooses, for every gate input, a linear combination of registers and previous gates. As long as the coefficients of the linear combination are non-negative and sum to one (a weighted average), the inputs to the gates will still be probability distributions, and so the gates described above will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, let $o_1, o_2, \\ldots, o_Q$ be the outputs of modules $m_1, m_2, \\ldots, m_Q$, respectively. Let $\\vec a_i$ and $\\vec b_i$ be the outputs of the controller (column vectors where each element is the weight assigned to some previous register or gate output).  The inputs to module $m_i$, then, are $A$ and $B$ (if the module is binary) defined by\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",

(In order to ensure that the components of $\\vec a_i$ and $\\vec b_i$ add up to one, so that $A$ and $B$ are valid probability distributions, the final layer of the controller is a [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) layer.) If the module is unary, then only $A$ is used, and if the module is a constant, then no controller outputs are necessary for it. The list of modules is ordered, so each module can only access the outputs of modules that preceed it in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if there are three registers and three gates (ADD, ZERO, EQZ), then $\\vec a_2$ will be the vector of coefficients for the 3rd gate (EQZ), and will have five weights in it (three for registers, one for ADD output, one for ZERO output); the input to EQZ will be the weighted combination of those five distributions (3 registers, 2 gates).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the controller chooses a weighted average of old register values and gate outputs as the values to be written to the registers after every time step. The new values written to the registers at the end of the timestep are\n",
    "$$r_i' = \\bmatr{r_1 & r_2 & \\cdots & r_R & o_1 & o_2 & \\cdots & o_Q} \\vec c_i,$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The inputs to the controller will come from the registers. Instead of providing the entire register vector to the controller, only the first component will be provided – the component that corresponds to the probability of the register being zero. This prevents the controller from trying to learn the algorithms itself, instead forcing it to rely on the circuits it generates. Since the controller is only provided the first component, it must use every register just as a boolean value, and decide what to do based on that; this functionality is the decision-making and branching part of the machine."

    "### Cost Function for Training\n",

    "To use this register-based machine once it is trained, we will initialize the registers with the inputs to the algorithm. Then we will run the system forward timestep-by-timestep until it produces the desired output. Unlike sequence-to-sequence learning, though, our system has no natural \"end\". Thus, we have two choices:\n",

    "- Run the system for a fixed and constant number of timesteps $T$, and train it to produce the result we want at the end.\n",
    "- Train the system to decide, on its own, when it is done.\n",

    "The authors of the NRAM paper chose to do the second, and so we'll do the same.\n",

However, in addition to outputting $\\vec a_i$, $\\vec b_i$, and $\\vec c_i$ described above, the controller will output a $f_t \\in \\R$ at every timestep $t$, which is the willingness to complete at that timestep. This willingness to complete represents the probability that the controller would like to terminate after this step.\n",

In addition, since probabilities must sum to one, at the last timestep $T$ $p_T$ is chosen such that the sum of all the $p_i$s sums to one:\n",

    "### Introducing Random-Access Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our register-based machine can learn simple algorithms, those algorithms are quite limited – they can only use as much memory as there are registers. If we add registers, we must also add corresponding weights to the neural network and retrain it; it does not generalize to larger memory sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this we can add a variable-sized memory bank. This memory bank $\\mathcal{M}$ will consist of $M$ integer values (where $M$ is also the number of representable integers); that is, $\\mathcal{M} \\in \\R^{M \\times M}$, since each value in the memory bank is again a distribution over integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the memory bank has $M$ cells, and each integer in our system can have one of $M$ values, we can interpret these values as pointers to locations in the memory bank. We can then use these pointers to read and write from the memory bank through two new gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these, the READ gate, will take a pointer $\\ell$, and read the value stored at that location in the memory bank. Since the pointer is a probability distribution, the result will be the weighted average of the values at all the cells in the memory bank, weighted by the probability masses:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{READ}(\\ell) = \\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \\ell_i \\mathcal{M}_i,$$\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{M}_i \\in \\R^M$ is the value stored at cell $i$ of the memory bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second gate, the WRITE gate, will take a pointer $\\ell$ and a value $v$, and write the value to the location indicated by the pointer. Again, the pointer is a probability distribution, so the gate will write a little bit of the value to each location in the memory bank, as indicated by the probability mass. For consistency, the gate will output the value it writes, but it will also modify the memory bank; if we have a gate $\\text{WRITE}(\\ell, v)$, the values in the memory bank will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{M}_i' = (1 - \\ell_i) \\mathcal{M}_i + \\ell_i v,$$\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{M}_i'$ is the new value in cell $i$ after the gate operation completes. Thus, if the probability mass $\\ell_i$ associated with cell $i$ is zero, then the value will stay exactly the same as in the previous step; if $\\ell_i = 1$, then the value will be completely overwritten with the new value $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can reformulate our cost in terms of the memory rather than the registers while keeping the structure roughly the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(\\theta) = -\\sum_{t = 1}^T p_t \\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \\log(\\mathcal{M}^{(t)}_{i,y_i}),$$\n",
    "where $y_i$ is the value that should be stored in cell $i$ at completion of the algorithm. The only change to this cost function as opposed to the previous one is that it accesses the memory bank, rather than the registers; other than that it is identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these two gates and modified cost function, we achieve something very interesting: namely, our neural network is completely independent of $M$. We can change the maximum representable integer without having to create a new set of parameters and retrain our network. As noted in the intro, this flexibility is part of the power of formulating this as a neural network controller – without changing the network or increasing its complexity itself, we added two gates, and in doing so completely changed the set of problems our machine could handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "With random-access memory, our machine should be able to handle algorithmic problems, such as copying elements in an array, searching through a list of values, or traversing a search tree stored in memory. The original publication tries several tasks, and finds that for simple tasks (reversing an array), the machine can perform perfectly, but for more complex tasks it does make some mistakes (such as in list merging or walking a binary search tree)."

We dubbed this simplified machine a neural *register* machine, since it lacks random-access memory but has a fixed set of registers to store data. In this post, we'll implement the register machine using [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), and then train it on a very simple example. We'll then demonstrate how we could extend this to the full NRAM model, showing how to implement the READ and WRITE gates.\n",

    "## Training Tips and Tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "Training this machine can get a bit tricky. Depending on the complexity of the task, it has a tendency to quickly converge to a local minimum and get stuck there. The following are a few tricks to get past these local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Add Gaussian noise to the gradients after backpropagation, and let the magnitude of the Gaussian noise decay with the iteration timestep. This forces the model to explore a bit more during the early iterations, and can help it avoid those local minima. (See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06807).)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "During backpropagation, the gradients have a tendency to get quite large for deeper networks. Clipping the gradients to some minimum and maximum values can help remediate this. Theano offers the [`grad_clip` operator](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/gradient.html#theano.gradient.grad_clip) specifically for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalizing the gradient to some fixed constant magnitude after backpropagation can be helpful, although in my experience this is less important with ADAM or similar optimization methods as opposed to straightforward SGD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Curriculum Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than immediately training on your target problem, attempt to break the problem down into incremental steps, and train first on the easiest problem, then a mix of the easiest and harder problems, and so on, gradually increasing the difficulty (by mixing in harder and harder examples in the batches). In my experience, this was necessary for almost all tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entropy Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to encourage the model to explore before settling on a local minimum, add a \"bonus\" (as opposed to penalty) to the cost function for high-entropy distributions. This prevents the model from just outputting a single value early on; decrease the entropy bonus (exponentially) throughout training. Shannon entropy of the probability distributions works nicely:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(\\vec A) = \\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} A_i \\log A_i.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(\\vec A)$ is high when the distribution is spread out, and low when it is concentrated at a single point."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, building and training these models takes some practice and time; debugging them when they don't work can be tricky. A combination of the tips and tricks from above, as well as others, can often help coax these models into learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to play with this model yourself, check out the [Github repository]() – it contains all the code necessary to build the full NRAM network, and depends only on Numpy and Theano. You can teach the machine surprisingly complex operations with very few neural network parameters! You can choose one of the tasks from the publication, or invent your own."
